## NHL Goaltenders from 2017-2018 season

We tried to explore goaltenders and consider who was the best goaltender of the 2017-2018 season as described by our data analysis below.

### Goalies sorted by save percentage ('SV%')

What issues do you notice by using this metric to rank goalies?

* issue 1
* issue 2
* issue 3

### Plot
<!--{% include plotly_demo_2.html %}-->

<!-- Filter out the goalies using your proposed approach above, and produce a bar plot with player names on the y-axis and save percentage (‘SV%’) on the x-axis. You can keep the top 20 goalies. Ensure all of the axes are labeled and the title is appropriate. -->

### Conclusion

Discuss what other features could potentially be useful in determining a goalie’s performance.

* feature 1
* feature 2
* feature 3

## Data acquisition of NHL play-by-play data from season 2016-2017 to 2020-2021

Sanity check: [Game ID 2016020001](https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/2016020001/feed/live/)

<!-- 
The first 4 digits identify the season of the game (ie. 2017 for the 2017-2018 season). The next 2 digits give the type of game, where 01 = preseason, 02 = regular season, 03 = playoffs, 04 = all-star. The final 4 digits identify the specific game number. For regular season and preseason games, this ranges from 0001 to the number of games played. (1271 for seasons with 31 teams (2017 and onwards) and 1230 for seasons with 30 teams). For playoff games, the 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of the playoffs, the 3rd digit specifies the matchup, and the 4th digit specifies the game (out of 7).

### Tutorial

<!-- Write a brief tutorial on how your team downloaded the dataset. Imagine :) that you were searching for a guide on how to download the play-by-play data; your guide should make you go “Perfect - this is exactly what I was looking for!”. This can be as simple as copying in your function and an example usage, and writing one or two sentences describing it. -->

### Interactive Debugging Tool

Use: [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with `IntSlider` while specifying function arguments and show it via matplotlib.

Able to specify season (year,regular or playoffs) and flip through all events for every game.

Draw event coordinates on an ice rink figure.

## Tidy Data

[Useful](https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/playTypes)

* Create a function to convert all events of every game into a pandas dataframe
* include events of the type “shots” and “goals”
* include as features (at minimum): game time/period information, game ID, team information (which team took the shot), indicator if its a shot or a goal, the on-ice coordinates, the shooter and goalie name (don’t worry about assists for now), shot type, if it was on an empty net, and whether or not a goal was at even strength, shorthanded, or on the power play.

1. include a small snippet of your final dataframe (e.g. using head(10)) screenshot.
2. You’ll notice that the “strength” field (i.e. even, power play, short handed) only exists for goals, not shots.(shot strength extrapolate players on ice within shot time) Furthermore, it doesn’t include the actual strength of players on the ice (i.e. 5 on 4, or 5 on 3, etc). Discuss how you could add the actual strength information (i.e. 5 on 4, etc.) (actually strength by relative ratio of players) to both shots and goals, given the other event types (beyond just shots and goals) and features available. You don’t need to implement this for this milestone. 

3. In a few sentences, discuss some additional features you could consider creating from the data available in this dataset. We’re not looking for any particular answers, but if you need some inspiration, could a shot or goal be classified as a rebound, or a shot off the rush?
